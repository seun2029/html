    <p id="last paragraph">

        The first link should link to an image called blue-whale.jpg, which is located in a directory called blue inside the current directory. <br>
The second link should link to an image called narwhal.jpg, which is located in a directory called narwhal, which is located one directory level above the current directory. <br>
The third link should link to the UK Google Image search. The base URL is https://www.google.co.uk, and the image search is located in a subdirectory called imghp. <br>
The fourth link should link to the paragraph at the very bottom of the current page. It has an ID of bottom. <br> Note: The first three links in the example have the target="_blank" attribute set on them, so that when you click on them, they open the linked page in a new tab.  This is not strictly best practice, but we've done it here so that the pages don't open in the embedded , getting rid of your example code in the process!
